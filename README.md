PHP Commons
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pascaldevink/php-commons.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pascaldevink/php-commons)

This module wraps commonly used PHP functions so they can be used in a object oriented way.
This way they:

 * have a better and more concise structure
 * are easier to use
 * are easier to read
 * are easy to replace
 * are easy to test
 * are easy to mock

Plus, they sometimes combine multiple native functions to make life easier in general.

Installation
------------

PHP Commons can be installed using composer:
    "require": {
        "pascaldevink/php-commons": "dev-master"
    }
